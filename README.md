# Go-Boilerplate

    Welcome to my Go-Boilerplate repository! This is a personal project where I'm piecing together a comprehensive foundation for kickstarting Go (Golang) projects. I'm excited to share the components and features I'm gradually incorporating.
    Here's what I've got planned:

## Basic Project Structure:

    In Progress: I'm working on defining a clear, conventional directory structure. Expect to see organized folders for the main application, tests, libraries, and documentation.

## Sample Code:

    In Progress: I'll provide basic Go code examples. Look out for a simple "Hello, World!" app, a REST API endpoint, or a basic CLI application.

## Dependency Management:

    In Progress: I'll include a go.mod file for handling dependencies, utilizing Go Modules - the standard in Go for dependency management.

## Configuration Management:

    In Progress: I'm setting up a system to manage configurations, possibly through environment variables, .env files, or config files (like JSON, YAML, or TOML).

## Logging:

    In Progress: I'm establishing a logging framework for the application. This might range from Go's built-in logging package to a more advanced library.

## Error Handling:

    In Progress: I'm developing a consistent approach for error handling in the application.

## Testing:

    Done: I've included sample tests and set up a testing framework. Go's built-in testing package is in use here.

## Docker Support:

    Done: You'll find a Dockerfile and possibly a docker-compose.yml file for containerization, a common need in many projects.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Setup:

    Done: There's a basic CI configuration file for platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.

## Documentation:

    Done: I've provided a README file and inline code comments for guidance. Also, look for a CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines on contributing to this project.

## Linter/Formatter Configuration:

    Done: I've included configurations for a linter (like golint or golangci-lint) and a formatter (like gofmt or goimports) to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Security Best Practices:

    Done: I've implemented and documented basic security best practices, covering secret handling, input validation, and error management.

## API Documentation :

    Planned: If this boilerplate includes an API, I'll add Swagger or a similar tool for API documentation.

Stay tuned as I continue to build and refine this repository. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
